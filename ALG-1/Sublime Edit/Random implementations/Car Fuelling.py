# car fuelling implementation

#problem :- select the minimum number of stops for fuel along the path length L. Assume initially the car has full tank gas.
#capacity of the car is C
# inputs:
#1.Array of stops in distance from start to end
#2.Capacity of the car C
#3.Total path distance L



def stops(da,capacity,length):
	




































#main
distances = input("Enter the distances")
da = int(distances).split()
capacity = input("Enter tank capacity")
length = input("Enter the total length of the path")
print(stops(da,capacity,length))
#main - copy paste code to read from standard input - modify this
input = sys.stdin.readline()
